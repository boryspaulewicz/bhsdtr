#' Calculates the combined response variable given the available information.
#'
#' \code{combined_response} calculates combined responses given the information
#' about the stimulus, ratings, and accuracy or decision.
#'
#' This function calculates the variable distribution of which is modelled by
#' Signal Detection Theory. If ratings are not provided this becomes a simple
#' binary classification decision: 1 (2) = participant decided that the stimulus
#' belongs to class 1 (2). If ratings are provided the resulting variable
#' indicates how strongly does the participant feel that the stimulus belongs to
#' the second class. For example, if ratings represent confidence on a 1-4 scale
#' and participant decided that stimulus = 1 with maximum confidence then
#' response = 1, if participant decided that stimulus = 1 with confidence 1 then
#' response = 4, if participant decided that stimulus = 2 with confidence 1 then
#' response = 5, if participant decided that stimulus = 2 with confidence = 4
#' then response = 8.
#'
#' @param stimulus a vector encoding the stimulus class. This can be of any type
#'   as long as it contains only two kinds of values, which will be converted to
#'   1 and 2 if necessary.
#' @param rating a vector of ratings. Ratings have to be encoded as intergers
#'   and all the possible values between min(rating) and max(rating) have to be
#'   present in the data. Either ratings or accuracy has to be provided. When
#'   ratings are not provided the resulting combined response is just the binary
#'   classification response calculated based on the provided accuracy and
#'   stimulus information.
#' @param accuracy an optional numeric vector: 1 = a correct, 0 = an incorrect
#'   binary classification response. Either \code{accuracy} or \code{decision}
#'   has to be provided.
#' @param decision an optional numeric vector: i = participant decided that the
#'   stimulus belongs to class 1, j = participant decided that the stimulus
#'   belongs to class 2, where j > i. Either \code{accuracy} or \code{decision}
#'   has to be provided.
#' @return a vector of combined or binary response values.
#' @examples
#' data(gabor)
#' ## Using this function we can obtain binary classification decisions from stimulus and accuracy data
#' gabor$dec = combined_response(gabor$stim, accuracy = gabor$acc)
#' ## ... or we can obtain combined response values
#' gabor$resp = combined_response(gabor$stim, gabor$rating, gabor$acc)
#' aggregate(resp ~ rating + dec, gabor, unique)
#' ## This is false, because gabor$stim encodes stimulus classess as 0 or 1 and dec encodes the decision as 1 or 2
#' all(gabor$acc == (gabor$stim == gabor$dec))
#' ## but this is true so we're fine
#' all(gabor$acc == ((gabor$stim+1) == gabor$dec))
