Description: Flexible fitting of hierarchical or non-hierarchical bayesian Signal Detection Theory models 
    with or without ratings with correlated random effects. The SDT parameters (sensitivity 
    and criteria) are derived from unconstrained parameters (delta and gamma) allowing the delta
    and gamma parameters to be linearly regressed on additional variables within the same model.
