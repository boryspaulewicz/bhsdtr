\title{Calculates the combined response variable given the available information.}
\usage{
combined_response(stimulus, rating = NULL, accuracy = NULL, decision = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{stimulus}{a vector encoding the stimulus class. This can be of any type
as long as it contains only two kinds of values, which will be converted to
1 and 2 if necessary.}

\item{rating}{a vector of ratings. Ratings have to be encoded as intergers
and all the possible values between min(rating) and max(rating) have to be
present in the data. Either ratings or accuracy has to be provided. When
ratings are not provided the resulting combined response is just the binary
classification response calculated based on the provided accuracy and
stimulus information.}

\item{accuracy}{an optional numeric vector: 1 = a correct, 0 = an incorrect
binary classification response. Either \code{accuracy} or \code{decision}
has to be provided.}

\item{decision}{an optional numeric vector: i = participant decided that the
stimulus belongs to class 1, j = participant decided that the stimulus
belongs to class 2, where j > i. Either \code{accuracy} or \code{decision}
has to be provided.}
}
\value{
a vector of combined or binary response values.
}
\description{
\code{combined_response} calculates combined responses given the information
about the stimulus, ratings, and accuracy or decision.
}
\details{
This function calculates the variable distribution of which is modelled by
Signal Detection Theory. If ratings are not provided this becomes a simple
binary classification decision: 1 (2) = participant decided that the stimulus
belongs to class 1 (2). If ratings are provided the resulting variable
indicates how strongly does the participant feel that the stimulus belongs to
the second class. For example, if ratings represent confidence on a 1-4 scale
and participant decided that stimulus = 1 with maximum confidence then
response = 1, if participant decided that stimulus = 1 with confidence 1 then
response = 4, if participant decided that stimulus = 2 with confidence 1 then
response = 5, if participant decided that stimulus = 2 with confidence = 4
then response = 8.
}
\examples{
data(gabor)
## Using this function we can obtain binary classification decisions from stimulus and accuracy data
gabor$dec = combined_response(gabor$stim, accuracy = gabor$acc)
## ... or we can obtain combined response values
gabor$resp = combined_response(gabor$stim, gabor$rating, gabor$acc)
aggregate(resp ~ rating + dec, gabor, unique)
## This is false, because gabor$stim encodes stimulus classess as 0 or 1 and dec encodes the decision as 1 or 2
all(gabor$acc == (gabor$stim == gabor$dec))
## but this is true so we're fine
all(gabor$acc == ((gabor$stim+1) == gabor$dec))
}
