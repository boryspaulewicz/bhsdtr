# NEWS: Two additional link functions for the criteria

In the current version of the package there are three link functions
for the SDT criteria to choose from. One is the link function
described in the preprint - this is now called "softmax". This link
function (softmax followed by inverse normal CDF) is computationally
intensive and makes the task of specifying the priors for the gamma
vector difficult.

The two new simple link functions *preserve the ordering of the
criteria and at the same time allow for individual criteria effects*,
which was arguably the main contribution of the bhsdtr package in its
previous version. The default values of the *gamma_sd* (fixed effects
specification) and the *gamma_scale* parameters (random effects
specification) for the new link functions are now set to 2, but this
is based on a small number of tests with real datasets.

Note also that adding the *init_r = l* where l < 2 argument to the
*stan* function call limits the range of initial values to (-l, l)
instead of the default range (-2, 2). This really helps with all the
link functions, because a value close to 2 (or -2) is often well
outside the range of reasonable values for some of the gamma/delta
parameters.

Anyway, the unconstrained gamma vector can be mapped to the ordered
criteria vector in many ways. Note that the main criterion (the K/2
threshold) considered in isolation is an uncostrained parameter. The
rest of the criteria can be represented as log-distances between
criteria or as log-ratios of distances between criteria. For example,
the K/2+1 criterion can be represented as log(c_<sub>K+1</sub> -
c<sub>K/2</sub>). This general idea leads to some intuitive
solutions. One is:

the main criterion is unconstrained:

c_<sub>K/2</sub> = &gamma;<sub>K/2</sub>

the criteria above the main criterion are represented as
log-distances, e.g.:

c<sub>K/2+3</sub> = c<sub>K/2+2</sub> + exp(&gamma;<sub>K/2+3</sub>)

and similarly for the criteria below the main criterion, e.g.:

c<sub>K/2-3</sub> = c<sub>K/2-2</sub> - exp(&gamma;<sub>K/2-3</sub>)

This is the "log_distance" gamma link function. The prior for
&gamma;<sub>K/2</sub> is now easy to specify, because this element of
the &gamma; vector represents the position of the main criterion
relative to the midpoint between the evidence distribution means,
i.e., the value of 0 corresponds to no bias and the positive
(negative) values correspond to the tendency to respond "noise"
("signal"). The priors for all the other elements of the &gamma;
vector are almost as easy to specify. For example, the assumption that
the average distance between the criteria is probably .5 can be
represented by setting the means of the priors for the &gamma; vector
(except for &gamma;<sub>K/2</sub>) at log(.5).

The other link function is called "log_ratio". The K/2th element again
represents the main criterion, the &gamma;<sub>K/2+1</sub> element
represents log(c<sub>K/2+1</sub> - c<sub>K/2</sub>), which I like to
call the "spread" parameter, because all the other distances are
represented in terms of this one. The &gamma;<sub>K/2-1</sub> element
represents the assymetry between the lower and the upper spread of the
criteria which are next to the main criterion, i.e., the following
log-ratio of distances (hence the name of the link function):
log((c<sub>K/2</sub> - c<sub>K/2-1</sub>) / (c<sub>K/2+1</sub> -
c<sub>K/2</sub>)). The elements &gamma;<sub>K/2+i</sub> where i > 1
also represent ratios of distances, i.e., &gamma;<sub>K/2+i</sub> =
log((c<sub>K/2+i</sub> - c<sub>K/2+i-1</sub>) / (c<sub>K/2+1</sub> -
c<sub>K/2</sub>)), and I like to call them "upper consistency"
parameters. The elements &gamma;<sub>K/2-i</sub> where i > 1 are
"lower consistency" parameters, i.e., &gamma;<sub>K/2-i</sub> =
log((c<sub>K/2-i+1</sub> - c<sub>K/2-i</sub>) / (c<sub>K/2</sub> -
c<sub>K/2-1</sub>)). In SDT models the reasonable prior for the
log-ratio parameters has mean = log(1) = 0.

For those who enjoy this kind of thing, here is the *generalized link
function for ordered criteria*:

1) choose an index i between 1 and K-1, this will be your
unconstrained parameter

2) represent c<sub>i</sub> as &gamma;<sub>i</sub>

3) choose an index j from the remaining K-2 indices

4) represent c<sub>j</sub> as log of distance, i.e., c<sub>j</sub> +
exp(&gamma;<sub>i</sub>) or c<sub>j</sub> - exp(&gamma;<sub>i</sub>),
depending on which threshold is supposed to be to the right of the
other

5) choose an index k from the remaining K-3 indices

6) represent c<sub>k</sub> as log of distance between c<sub>k</sub>
and c<sub>i</sub> or between c<sub>k</sub> and c<sub>j</sub> or as log
of distance between c<sub>k</sub> and c<sub>i</sub> (or c<sub>k</sub>
and c<sub>j</sub>) divided by the distance between c<sub>j</sub> and
c<sub>i</sub>

7) etc.

A broad class of models, some of which can be thought of as simplified
in a meaningful way, can be obtained just by restricting the values of
the elements of the &gamma; vector when using the two new link
functions. For example, by using the "log_ratio" link function and
fixing all the ratios at log(1) = 0 we get, as a special case, the
parsimonious SDT model as described in this great
[paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13428-019-01231-3)
by Selker, van den Bergh, Criss, and Wagenmakers. The &gamma; vector
can also be constrained in other ways, in particular the constraints
can be soft (i.e., priors with small SDs) which means that a continuum
of more and more simplified models can be obtained. Moreover, the
effects of *numerical* predictors (e.g., presentation time, stimulus
intensity) on the &gamma; parameters may have a reasonably intuitive
interpretation or may not require a highly flexible polynomial to
approximate the relationship well.

In order to use the new link functions the appropriate name has to be
specified when calling the *make_stan_data*, *make_stan_model*, and
*gamma_to_crit* functions, as described in the documentation.

# bhsdtr

The bhsdtr (short for Bayesian Hierarchical Signal Detection Theory
with Ratings) package implements a novel method of Bayesian inference
for hierarchical or non-hierarchical equal variance normal Signal
Detection Theory models with one or more criteria. It uses the
state-of-the-art platform [Stan](http://mc-stan.org/) for sampling
from posterior distributions. Our method can accommodate binary
responses as well as additional ratings and an arbitrary number of
nested or crossed random grouping factors. SDT parameters can be
regressed on additional predictors within the same model via
intermediate unconstrained parameters, and the model can be extended
by using automatically generated human-readable Stan code as a
template.

## Background

The equal-variance SDT with one criterion is almost (d' is not constrained to be non-negative) quivalent to probit
regression (see [this
paper](http://www.columbia.edu/~ld208/psymeth98.pdf) by DeCarlo) which
means that any software capable of fitting hierarchical generalized
linear models can be used to fit the hierarchical version of
equal-variance SDT *with one criterion and possibly negative d'*. However, the single-criterion
SDT model is untestable, because the data and the model have the same
dimensionality. The main reason for using SDT is to deconfound
sensitivity and bias. This can only be achieved if an SDT model is
approximately true, but there is no way to test it in the
single-criterion case. An SDT model becomes testable (e.g., by
comparing the theoretical and the observed ROC curves) when it is
generalized - by introducing additional criteria - to the version that
accomodates ratings (e.g., "I am almost certain that this item is
new").

SDT is a *non-linear* model. An immediate consequence of non-linearity
is that inference based on data aggregated over "random" grouping
factors (such as subjects or items) is invalid, because the resulting
estimates are biased (see [this
paper](http://rouder.psyc.missouri.edu/sites/default/files/morey-jmp-zROC-2008_0.pdf)
by Morey, Pratte, and Rouder for a demonstration, or see our
[preprint](http://dx.doi.org/10.23668/psycharchives.2725) for an even
more striking demonstration). The only way to avoid this problem is to
model the (possibly correlated) effects of all the relevant random
grouping factors.

A subset of hierarchical SDT models with ratings can be fitted using
hierarchical ordered regression models, such as the cumulative model
in the excellent
[brms](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/brms/index.html)
package. As we explain [in the
preprint](http://dx.doi.org/10.23668/psycharchives.2725), the d'
parameter is non-negative by definition and ignoring this assumption
may lead to problems if a bayesian SDT model is used. Without some
modifications (which can be done in the brms package) hierarchical
ordinal regression models do not restrict the d' to be non-negative,
becaues in such models d' is just the unconstrained linear regression
slope that represents the effect of the stimulus class ("noise" or
"signal"). Moreover, in typical situations it does not make much sense
to assume that the d' random effects normally distributed. Finally, in
the cumulative model the parameters that correspond to the criteria in
an SDT model cannot be affected differently by the same grouping
factor (i.e., the effects are constant across categories), because the
criteria in this model are simply additional effects in the linear
part. This means that the model assumes that the pattern of the
criteria is the same for every participant (or item,
etc.). Participants differ in their criteria placement patterns and so
the data from a typical rating experiment cannot be independent given
an SDT model with ratings represented as a cumulative model.

In the bhsdtr package the generalized SDT model is supplemented with a
hierarchical linear regression structure (normally distributed
correlated random effects) thanks to a novel parametrization described
in [this preprint](http://dx.doi.org/10.23668/psycharchives.2725)
(which is now under review), and (more concisely) in the package
documentation. [Here](https://github.com/boryspaulewicz/bhsdtr/tree/master/inst/preprint/analysis_script.R)
is the annotated R script that performs all the analyses and produces
all the tables and some of the figures in the paper.

## Features

The bhsdtr package can be used to:

- fit generalized (more than one criterion), [meta-d'](http://www.columbia.edu/~bsm2105/type2sdt/), or basic (one criterion) equal variance SDT models
- fit hierarchical or non-hierarchical (e.g., single participant) models
- assess the fit using publication-ready ROC curve and combined response distribution plots with predictive intervals calculated for the chosen alpha level
- model the dependence of the SDT parameters on additional variables (e.g., task difficulty) using separate linear regression structures for the delta (d', meta-d') and gamma (criteria) parameters

### Prerequisites

A fairly up-to-date version of [R](https://www.r-project.org/) with
[the devtools
package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/devtools/index.html)
already installed.

## Installing

The bhsdtr package, together will all of its dependencies, can be
installed directly from this github repository using the devtools
package:

```
devtools::install_git('git://github.com/boryspaulewicz/bhsdtr')
```

The installed package can be loaded using:

```
library(bhsdtr)
```

## Usage example

The package contains the gabor dataset


```
data(gabor)
head(gabor)
?gabor
```

To fit a hierarchical SDT model to this data we need to create some
data structures required by the stan function. This is how you can
create the combined response variable that encodes both the binary
classification decision and rating:

```
gabor$r = combined_response(gabor$stim, gabor$rating, gabor$acc)
```

The combined responses have to be aggregated to make the sampling more
efficient. This is done using the aggregate_resoponses function, which
requires the names of the stimulus and the combined response
variables. If the data have a hierarchical structure, this structure
has to be preserved by listing the variables that cannot be collapsed
by the aggregation step. Here we list three variables that have to be
preserved: duration, id and order.

```
adata = aggregate_responses(gabor, 'stim', 'r', c('duration', 'id', 'order'))
```

Finally, the fixed and random effects structure has to be specified
using lists of R model formulae. Here we assume that d' (= exp(delta))
depends on duration (a within-subject variable) and order (a
between-subject variable), but gamma (from which the criteria
parameter vector is derived) depends only on order. There is only one
random grouping factor - id - which represents the subjects. Note that
the random effects specification is a *list of lists* of model
formulate. That's because there can be more than one random grouping
factor.

```
fixed = list(delta = ~ -1 + duration:order, gamma = ~ -1 + order)
random = list(list(group = ~ id, delta = ~ -1 + duration, gamma = ~ 1))
```

Now we can start sampling (note that the 'log_distance' link function
is used for the criteria instead of the detault 'softmax' and that the
*init_r* argument is added):

```
fit = stan(model_code = make_stan_model(random, gamma_link = 'log_distance'),
    data = make_stan_data(adata, fixed, random, gamma_link = 'log_distance'),
    pars = c('delta_fixed', 'gamma_fixed',
        'delta_sd_1', 'gamma_sd_1',
        'delta_random_1', 'gamma_random_1',
        'Corr_delta_1', 'Corr_gamma_1',
        ## we need counts_new for plotting
        'counts_new'),
    init_r = .5,
    iter = 8000,
    chains = 4)
```

When the make_stan_model and make_stan_data functions are called with
the optional metad=TRUE argument the meta-d' model is fitted. There
are two delta (d') parameters in the meta-d' model and so the
delta_fixed regression coefficients form a two-row matrix: the first
row represents the fixed effects for the d' parameter and the
second row represents the fixed effects for the meta-d' parameter.

The model fit can be assessed using the plot_sdt_fit function, which
produces ROC curve plots ...


```
plot_sdt_fit(fit, adata, c('order', 'duration')))
```

![ROC curve](inst/preprint/roc_fit.png)

... or combined response distribution plots:

```
plot_sdt_fit(fit, adata, c('order', 'duration'), type = 'response')
```

# The importance of Flexible Order-Preserving link functions in ordinal models

Response labels such as "noise" and "signal" can be viewed as values
of a nominal scale variable, however, from the point of view of Signal
Detection Theory such variables are in fact *ordinal*. That's because
in an SDT model the response "signal" corresponds to *higher* values
of internal evidence. Moreover, once the ratings (an ordinal variable)
are introduced the problem of confounding sensitivity and bias still
exists even if we consider only one kind of responses (e.g.,
"signal"); A participant may respond "high confidence" not because the
internal evidence is high, but because, for some reason, the labels
are used differently. It is just as unrealistic to assume that the
rating scale is invariant accros participants, items, or conditions as
it is to assume that the SDT decision criterion is constant. It leads
to exactly the same kind of problem when interpreting the results -
observed differences may indicate that what is supposed to be captured
by the ratings is different, or that the way the ratings are used is
different.

Consider a typical ordinal-scale variable in psychology, such as PAS
ratings, confidence ratings, or a Likert-scale item in a
questionnaire. It is natural to assume two things about such
variables:

1. *Order invariance*, i.e., whatever latent value X this outcome is
supposed to represent, higher observed values correspond to higher
values of X, e.g., higher confidence ratings correspond to higher
value (more "signal-like") of internal evidence in an SDT model, or
higher values in a questionnaire item correspond to higher values of
the property X measured by the questionnaire. When order invariance
does not hold, it indicates that the proces of generating the
responses changed in a *qualitative* way, e.g., the responses in a
binary classification task were reversed because task instructions
were misunderstood, or some of the possible responses in a
Likert-scale item were interpreted in a way that was not intended by
the authors of the questionnaire.

2. *Scale instability*, i.e., the thresholds that correspond to the
discrete outcome values or labels may differ between participants,
items, or conditions, or may covary with numerical predictors. In
fact, it would be more than just surprising if evidence was found that
the mapping between the values of ordinal responses and the latent
values captured by these responses is constant between participants,
conditions or items, since the thresholds that correspond to such
responses are parts of a psychological mechanism which is certain to
be more or less unique to each participant and cannot be assumed to be
stable across changing conditions.

Whenever ordinal variables are used, there is a possibility of
confounding "response bias", which in this case corresponds to the way
the response categories are used to label e.g., some internal
experience, and the internal experience itself. This problem is seen
as important in the context of binary classification tasks and SDT
theory, but it often seems to be ignored in other contexts.

Let's use the term *Flexible Order-Preserving link function* (FOP) to
denote an isomorphic function that maps the space of ordered real
vectors (i.e., *v<sub>j</sub> > v<sub>i</sub>* if *j > i*) to the
space of unresctricted real vectors *&gamma;* in such a way that
1. the order is preserved in a sense that *v<sub>i</sub>* is mapped to
*&gamma;<sub>i</sub>* and 2. *individual* thresholds/criteria are
"free", i.e., each element of *&gamma;* is unbounded and can be
related in an arbitrary way to nominal (participants, items,
conditions) or to numerical predictors.

*Any model which represents an ordinal variable in terms of ordered
thresholds can be supplemented with a hierarchical linear regression
structure using a FOP link function.*

A model that (unrealistically) assumes that the pattern of thresholds'
placement is constant cannot account for the possibility of scale
bias; If all the thresholds are shifted by the same amount in one
direction the effects are the same as if the thresholds stayed the
same but the latent value chenged. When the thresholds can be related
in a different way to various predictors deconfounding of latent
values from scale bias becomes possible. Once we assume something
about the distribution of latent values it may be possible to estimate
*non-uniform* changes in the thresholds, but only if the model can
account for such effects. FOP link functions make many such models
possible. In particular, FOP link functions make it possible to
supplement ordinal models with a hierarchical linear regression
structure in a way that accounts for the effects in latent values as
well as for the effects in the thresholds. Because ordinal models are
non-linear, supplementing them with a hierarchical linear regression
structure may solve the problem of interval and point estimate bias
introduced by aggregating the data or by otherwise ignoring
hierarchical data structure. The bayesian hierarchical SDT model as
implemented in the bhsdtr package is only one example.
